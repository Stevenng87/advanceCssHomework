    <h1>About</h1> <br>
    <h2>Me</h2>

    <p> Being born and raised in Hong Kong, I had the privilege to taste all kinds of food from different countries growing up, which deeply influence me in my career choice after I graduated.<br>
    As I develop my career in the kitchen for the past 10 years, I have realized that cooking actually have a lots in common with coding. They both require very specific details in all aspect, then by combining them together, a delicious and good looking meal is ready to be serve.
